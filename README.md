# carbon-emissions

## Project Description

This project seeks to understand how different emissions policy instruments influence predicted emissions rates and temperature forecasts, compared to BAU. The objective of this project is three fold:

1. Understand the efficacy of certain policy instruments over others
2. The degrees of stringency needed for different sectors
3. How many tons of current emissions can reasonably be reduced before looking towards carbon removal solutions

To address these questions, this project will pull global, sector-based emissions data from the GHG Protocol, global emissions policy data other, and publicly available sources to first **discover trends across industries and geographies** and **uncover the underlying cause for drastic changes** (both increases and decreases) in emissions rates. 

## Data

To answer the above questions, this project will pull global, sector-based emissions data and global emissions policy data to map emissions trends and policy efficacy.

## Background 

Global emissions rates have been on the rise since the industrial revolution, and are exacerbated by the globalization of economies and heavy energy reliance across the board. With increased anthropogenic emissions rates, stemming global warming requires strategic emissions reductions, electrification and renewable energy integration, and carbon removal. 
To optimize our approach and comittment to these reductions, a data-driven approach is critical to ensure the adoption of policies to drive decarbonization is seamless and effective.
